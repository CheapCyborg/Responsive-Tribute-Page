                Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails
                on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood.
                After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing
                his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable
                ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as
                the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, Literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves).
                He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve
                his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, Literally meaning: Seventh Fire
                Shadow).

            <h2>Where the journey begins</h2>
            <p>
                Failing once again to graduate from the Academy, a disappointed Naruto is advised by one of his instructors, Mizuki, to steal
                the Scroll of Seals and learn a technique from it in order to graduate. As Naruto struggled to learn the
                Shadow Clone Technique, Iruka Umino tracked him down and realised that Naruto was tricked by Mizuki into
                stealing the scroll. Mizuki attacked them and told Naruto about the Nine-Tails sealed within him, claiming
                that Iruka hated him because of it. When Iruka risked his life to protect Naruto, however, he saw through
                Mizuki's lies and used the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat him, prompting Iruka to happily grant
                Naruto his graduation from the Academy. Naruto would later befriend Konohamaru Sarutobi, grandson of the
                Third Hokage, and teach him several perverted or useful techniques.
